// Dummy code - does not really work
mysql.connect('sql-database-path', 'username', 'password')
    .then(db => db.query('SELECT * FROM todos'));

# The Real Problem: Security
This code is accessible by everyone though!

That’s why any code that “talks” to a database belongs onto a server: Your users can’t access that code. 
And your frontend (i.e. the Angular/ React/ Vue / … app) only sends Http requests to that backend server.

Typically, you therefore expose a REST API on your backend - that API can of course be written with any server-side language you want.
Node.js, PHP, Java - totally up to you!

angular -reactive forms/vs template driven?
